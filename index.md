# SATYA Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 2024

SATYA are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information when you use the SATYA Chrome Extension.

## What Data Do We Collect?

SATYA only collects website content (such as text, images, and structure) from the active tab to perform accessibility scans for compliance with IS 17802 and other accessibility standards. We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII), browsing history, or user activity.

## How Is Your Data Used?

The data collected during scans is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers. SATYA does not store or share any data beyond what is necessary for accessibility testing.

## Third-Party Sharing

SATYA does not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.

## User Control

Since SATYA operates locally and processes data in real-time, no data is stored after the scan is completed. You remain in full control of your data.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, feel free to contact us at:  accessibility.help@cdac.in
